### Diversity Statement
Diversity is a natural outcome when the underlying culture and processes are equitable and inclusive. While research has shown that diverse teams lead to better outcomes, the fundamental justification for inclusive spaces stems from a fairness viewpoint --  forming, enabling and sustaining diverse teams is the *right* thing to do.  

At the moment, there is an imbalance in representation in the workforce, particularly within the eresearch sector - where the people are pre-dominantly male. In the 2018 RSE survey in Australia, > 80% of Australian survey responders identified as male, and an even higher fraction identify as male in New Zealand. While gender is one such marginalised identity in this RSE space, there are many more such social identities that are routinely excluded. As a member of the RSE-AUNZ Steering Committee, I will  continue to work towards equity in all spaces that I have access to.

### Relevant Experience

*In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.*

I have nearly 20 years of experience in research, including almost 30 publications, numerous talks, conference proceedings. In recent years, I have also lead and assisted with organising research training activities for Australian astronomers.

I am a typical example of a Research Software Engineer. I spend a significant chunk of time writing and debugging code for my research groups (ARC Centre of Excellence, ASTRO 3D). I create and maintaining high-quality open-source research software and teach other researchers and students how to write code. Despite all of this necessary work around research software, the primary metric to measure my productivity is still the number of publications. I am also participating in various working groups to increase the recognition of the critical role of software within research, and make concrete recommendations where possible that can improve the current state of research software practices. 

*What skills will you bring to the committee?*

I am an academic involved in many aspects of research software -- designing and developing new software, maintaining old code-bases and training researchers in modern computing practices. I understand the challenges faced by both the vulnerable students and postdocs who lack the training to produce high quality research software. As a founding member of the current RSE chapter, I have the vision and leadership skills required to create and sustain a prosperous RSE community.

*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*

The key priorities for the RSE community are awareness and recognition for the RSE role. I am on several national committees in astronomy -- e.g., EMCR representative at the National Committee for Astronomy (Australian Academy of Science) and the immediate past-Chair of the Early Career Researcher Chapter for The Astronomical Society of Australia. I will continue to raise awareness for the critical role of software in research and recognition for the contribution from RSEs.
As a member of the committee, I would like to engage with national and international organisations to find concrete ways to improve diversity in the RSE community.

*If you have already contributed to the RSE community, please list those contributions below.*

In 2017, I took the initiative to contact with RSE UK to establish the current RSE Chapter in Australia and New Zealand. As a member of the Interim Steering Committee, I was involved with nearly all activities undertaken for the RSE community. These activities include the inaugural round table discussion at eResearch Australasia, in 2017, remote presentations for UKRSE Workshop (2017), various local and remote RSE meetups, C3DIS, the international RSE survey in 2018 etc. Since 2019, I have been a member of the RSE-AUNZ Steering Committee (SC). From early 2020, I took over as the Australian co-Chair of RSE-AUNZ. As a member of the RSE-AUNZ SC, I have lead/contributed/participated in all of the RSE-AUNZ events, including the upcoming RSE survey (2021).

### 1-year term (optional)
*If you would like to serve on a 1-year term (instead of the regular 2-year term), please note that here*

I am happy to be considered for a 1-year term if that makes forming the RSE-AUNZ SC easier (including adding new members into the SC)

[rowland.h.mosbergen@gmail.com](mailto:rowland.h.mosbergen@gmail.com)

### Diversity Statement

My diversity statement is defined on my website [Practical Diversity and Inclusion](https://www.rowlandm.com/about/)

### Relevant Experience

8 years as a RSE in genomics with Stemformatics, helped form the original interim steering committee as chair.

Strategic planning, community building and stakeholder management.

I would like to build a stronger sense of community, if possible. It would be nice to expand the NZ RSE conference to be NZ/AU and possibly even to Asia.

I would like to see if we could raise awareness of RSEs in industry and in the senior management of universities.

Contributions were a while ago, but setup the first mini-conference in 2019.

## Janet Stacey

*Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR), Auckland, New Zealand*
[janet.stacey@esr.cri.nz](mailto:janet.stacey@esr.cri.nz)

### Diversity Statement
I am a woman trying to dip my toes in the waters of software engineering, a sector that still leaves an impression of a pimply white nerdy guy sitting in his mums basement hacking the world.  I enjoy sharing my experiences and encouraging a range of gender, sexual and ethnically diverse people to change the way RSEs are viewed by our colleagues.  The more diverse voices we can get in the room, the better the outcomes will be of our work. We can do more to mitigate the risk of bias and shape our communication style to promote understanding and acceptance across all cultures. I am looking for ways to actively engage with others to achieve better, safer workplaces and outcomes for all.

### Relevant Experience

*In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.*
I have worked in research for my entire career (20 years) from a science perspective.  I began in medical research before spending 14 years as a technician in the forensic DNA laboratory. Technology in genomics was moving quickly so I retrained as a Bioinformatician and now work as a Digital Science Engineer (2 years).  This has involved automating analysis and reporting pipelines, dashboard creation, statistical analysis, and ML pipeline development. I am also an advocate for upskilling others in good data science principles by supervising accelerator and Master degree projects, informal mentorship, data carpentry workshops (I am a badged instructor) and involvement in data science direction and data sovereignty policy development in NZs Crown Research Institutes. My role at ESR leverages experience in service delivery of a product that must be maintained at a high quality due to its real-world consequences and being at the cutting edge of data science policy development.   

*What skills will you bring to the committee?*
I am enthusiastic and energised with all the ideals of someone fresh out of university but tempered by the experience of working in science in New Zealand. 
 

*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*

I am enthusiastic to get recognition of the RSE role in science.  I want us to be recognised by our industries as key people and have our acheivements noticed and understood as being different from your average scientist.  I want to improve communication among organisations to avoid reinventing the wheel and support projects to create long-lasting, well-thought outcomes.

*If you have already contributed to the RSE community, please list those contributions below.*

I have acted as a member of the organising committee for the NZ-RSE conference held in September 2021.

### 1-year term (optional)

I am happy to be considered for any term

## Justin Baker

*CSIRO, Melbourne.* 
[justin.baker@csiro.au](mailto:justin.baker@csiro.au)

### Diversity Statement
I am a strong advocate of the finding that diverse teams are better performing teams. 
This flows into my on going recruitment tasks, where I have assembled high-performing teams comprised of people from a range of backgrounds, ethnicities and a balance of genders. My current team at
CSIRO is a perfect example! 


### Relevant Experience

*In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.*

I have a BSc in Computer Science, Master of Information Technology and Grad Dip in Biotechnology & Business.

I have worked as a software developer at Monash University and the Bureau of Meteorology. 
I am currently leading the Data Analytics and Visualisation Team of eight RSEs in CSIRO’s Scientific Computing Group.

*What skills will you bring to the committee?*

During my career, I have occupied many IT based roles in the research support area. These include Senior IT Officer, Divisional IT Manager, Executive Officer, and RSE Team Lead. This experience – including software design and implementation, IT infrastructure support, team management and project management – provides me with a great perspective on the issues affecting individuals across the “RSE spectrum”. 


*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*

I’m really keen to see the RSE movement achieve recognition and acceptance in Australia, 
and for us to contribute to the movement internationally.

*If you have already contributed to the RSE community, please list those contributions below.*

I have been an active member of the RSE-AUNZ steering committee since 2019 and would like to continue in the role.

I have successfully presented abstracts and BoFs at eResearch Australasia, eResearch NZ and C3DIS on various topics including Metrics for the RSE Community, Creating an RSE Community in a complex
ecosystem, Scientific Visualisation and the delivery of eResearch services.
